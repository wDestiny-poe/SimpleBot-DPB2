# Simple Project for DreamPoeBot2

It is based on some old stuff found from ExileBuddy: http://51.75.249.226:9001/Exilebuddy.zip and from DPB1 3rdparty folder

The objective of this project is to make a start point for new developers and users - I do not intend to give full support and develop it to a full working bot

Any suggestions and contributions are very much appreciated 

*Note*: You probably will have to follow the steps to create a template plugin from here https://github.com/Letale-vc/DPB2Plugintemplate up to "Setting the Path (Windows)"
